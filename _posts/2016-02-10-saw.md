position is the top-left node in all cases. Note the 9x9 success took approximately 1M
attempts to achieve.

I have simulated many random walks, <i>e.g.</i> one to three dimensional drunkards,
plinko, gaussian random walks, brownian motion. The
self-avoiding walk (SAW) is a nice spin-off of the 2D random walk resulting
in pictures that are reminscent of
a maze. The idea is to randomly traverse a lattice without
returning to an already visited node; therefore, all lattice nodes
must be touched once (no more and no less) in order for the walk to be a success.
The walker only moves in the vertical and horizontal directions so only
four directions need to be considered. For efficiency, a table that maps
each node to a list of its nearest neighbors (four neighbors is max) is constructed. 
The algorithm then starts in the top left corner and generates a random move. 
When a node has been visited, it is removed from the list of neighbors and
will not be considered in subsequent maneuvers.
If the random walker touches
every node, then the simulation is said to be a success. On the other hand,
if the random walker encounters a situation when no neighbors are available then
the simulation is a failure.
The algorithm is <i>very inefficient</i> for large lattices due to the nature
of random numbers and the number of possible paths (which can be calculated with
knowledge of binomial/combinatorics).
The distribution of attempts needed for a success with a 5x5 lattice may be
seen within Fig. 2 which includes 5,000 SAW simulations. The exercise
has been repeated for 6x6 resulting in a similar distribution in shape
with a significantly larger spread (mean and standard deviation
jumps to roughly 360 and 350, respectively).
