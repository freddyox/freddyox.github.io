  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Cross-sectional view of the BigHand detector during a neutron event.
  A neutron enters the detector
  from the left and deposits energy (red) as it propagates through the detector planes.
  The goal is to use low-level detector information in order to classify the particle species
  (we do not know this!)
  which in this case is either proton or neutron.</figcaption>

Understanding how neutrons and protons are classified within the BigHand detector package
represented an important analysis task during my PhD thesis; the original method will be
discussed briefly. I have revisited the classification problem roughly one year later except
in this case I will be using machine learning tools, specifically a random forest model and
a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach. The newer methods produce outstanding results
and have greatly increased the classification accuracy relative to the original machinery.
By far the most difficult task was acquiring the appropriate data, and conditioning it
such that a Random Forest/CNN may be used.
