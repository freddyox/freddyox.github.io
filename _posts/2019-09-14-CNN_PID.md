  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Cross-sectional view of the BigHand detector. A neutron enters the detector
  from the left and deposits energy (red) as it propagates through the detector modules.
  The goal is to use low-level detector information in order to classify the particle species
  which in this case is either proton or neutron.</figcaption>
