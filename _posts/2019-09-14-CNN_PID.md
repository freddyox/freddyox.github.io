  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Cross-sectional view of the BigHand detector during a neutron event.
  A neutron enters the detector
  from the left and deposits energy (red) as it propagates through the detector planes.
  The goal is to use low-level detector information in order to classify the particle species
  (we do not know this!)
  which in this case is either proton or neutron.</figcaption>

Understanding how neutrons and protons are classified within the BigHand detector package
represents an important analysis task during my PhD thesis; the original method will be
discussed briefly. I have revisited the classification problem roughly one year later except
in this case I will be using machine learning tools, specifically a random forest model and
a convolution neural network (CNN) approach. Both methods produce outstanding results and have greatly
increased the classification accuracy. By far the most difficult task was acquiring the appropriate
data, and conditioning it such that a CNN may be used.
