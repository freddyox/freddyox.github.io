## Overview
There are times when a student begins a coding project and the end-goal turns out to be
absolutely worthless, and admittedly this is one of posts.
I wanted to replicate a complete game from scratch (menus, high scores, user-interactions,
and a purpose), but a Snake game is not that much fun to play anymore! However,
the Snake project, which was inspired by <a href="http://slither.io/">slither.io<a/> combined
with the game from the late 70s, was fun to make and a great learning experience.
The game is simple: eat food and grow, but do not run in to the wall or cross over yourself.
The program was coded from scratch with C++
and the SFML libraries for drawing primitive shapes and basic event-handling (e.g. hitting
a letter on the keyboard), and includes the following:
<ol>
<li>a menu framework including high scores and a screen for the player to type the name</li>
<li>a snake made out of overlapping circles in an alternating rainbow pattern</li>
<li>randomly placed food of varying sizes (larger sizes increase the score/snake more) and the
    food moves in a circular path of some random radius to make it more difficult</li>
<li>a point system based on food consumption</li>
<li>the snake is controlled by the arrows, and may be accelerated to larger speeds with the space-bar</li>
<li>when the snake hits the wall or itself (which requires simple collision detection),
   a death method is invoked which includes increasing the radii of the circles making up the snake.</li>
</ol>
The game is silly, obviously, and I probably could not even get my 5 year old nephew to play this
even if I paid him... BUT this was the first game and it was important to finish what I started.
Making the game more advanced, e.g. adding
other competing snakes with some automation, is now simply a matter of investing more time.
See the figure for some screen shots of the menus, game, and death.
