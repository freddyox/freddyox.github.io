Disclaimer: I got the idea from <a href="https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/">this blogging site</a>, but the implementation/algorithms are mine. Additionally, I used the bare-bones SFML library which required
significant image processing and filtering methods to be developed; this has been done on purpose for my own education!
