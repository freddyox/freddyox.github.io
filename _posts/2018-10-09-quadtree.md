The quadtree post serves two purposes: to learn JavaScript in order to make interactive
code run on the site, and to gain more experience with tree structures. I had been playing
around with binary trees and graphs, and wanted to implement a visual
representation of a tree structure. The quadtree idea and implementation may be seen by many sources
(Wiki has decent pseudocode). In complete analogy to a binary tree, a quadtree
may be recursively built but now 4 children nodes are possible.
Of importance to me, though, is that the structure allows for a rapid search or query
of neighboring balls, which is useful in the context of 2D collisions for example.
The naive algorithm to search for nearest neighbors is <i>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> for each ball, one must check the position of every other ball which is a
double for-loop algorithm (with some minor optimizations that are possible). The
quadtree may be used in order to return a sub-list of balls that are in the vicinity
of the ball in question; the result may then be used for collision detection, which
is a significant improvement relative to the naive approach for many balls.
