## Overview
I am currently a nuclear/particle physics Ph.D. student expecting to graduate over the summer of 2018.
While I am a student at U.Conn., I am stationed at <a href="https://www.jlab.org/">Jefferson Laboratory</a> in Newport News, VA.

## Ph.D. Research Interests

<p>The overwhelming majority of visible matter is composed of nucleons making
it arguably the most important strongly interacting system to study.
Nature's most prominent particle may naively be thought of as a composite object
built out of three non-interacting sub-objects, known as quarks, in the large
energy limit; however, the structure of the nucleon is much more complicated,
and consequently far richer, than a simple valence-quark picture. 
There are sea quarks in addition to valence quarks that interact strongly
via the exchange of gluons resulting in a complex vacuum structure, 
and all of which must collectively give rise to the observed
properties of the nucleon, <i>e.g.</i> the radius and mass.
The nucleon is perhaps the most well-studied
hadron and yet there are still difficulties associated with
the prediction of fundamental properties from first principles;
<i>this represents a central problem in nuclear physics</i>. The theoretical difficulty with 
the nucleon requires intensive experimentation, which is steadily
increasing our knowledge of hadron structure and the strong interaction.
My research interests revolve around utilizing fundamental scattering
interactions to probe the nucleon structure in order to
contribute towards a complete understanding of the nucleon.</p>
