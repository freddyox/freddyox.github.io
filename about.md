## Overview
I am currently a nuclear/particle physics Ph.D. student expecting to graduate over the summer of 2018.
While I am a student at U.Conn., I am stationed at <a href="https://www.jlab.org/">Jefferson Laboratory</a> in Newport News, VA.
<p>Thesis: <i>Electric form factor ratio of the neutron at Q<sup>2</sup>=1.16 GeV<sup>2</sup>
from asymmetry measurements</i></p>

## Ph.D. Research Interests

<p>The overwhelming majority of visible matter is composed of nucleons making
it arguably the most important strongly interacting system to study.
Nature's most prominent particle may naively be thought of as a composite object
built out of three non-interacting sub-objects, known as quarks, in the large
energy limit; however, the structure of the nucleon is much more complicated,
and consequently far richer, than a simple valence-quark picture. 
There are sea quarks in addition to valence quarks that interact strongly
via the exchange of gluons resulting in a complex vacuum structure, 
and all of which must collectively give rise to the observed
properties of the nucleon, <i>e.g.</i> the radius and mass.
The nucleon is perhaps the most well-studied
hadron and yet there are still difficulties associated with
the prediction of fundamental properties from first principles;
<i>this represents a central problem in nuclear physics</i>. The theoretical difficulty with 
the nucleon requires intensive experimentation, which is steadily
increasing our knowledge of hadron structure and the strong interaction.
My research interests revolve around utilizing fundamental scattering
interactions to probe the nucleon structure in order to
contribute towards a complete understanding of the nucleon.</p>

  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - A Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detector used for particle
  identification (protons, pions, and kaons). The picture depicts many cables which
  are the signal and high voltage connections to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). There
  are 1,934 PMTs in this particular RICH detector, and the signals are used
  in the analysis to reconstruct cherenkov cones. The electronics on the left handle
  low-level signal processing; the detector is made out of copper/aluminum and vacuum sealed.
  Inside the detector exists a large spherical mirror array, aerogel tiles, and a very
  expensive/toxic gas (atleast when it was used during the HERMES experiments). The
  detector is currently being re-purposed for use in the upcoming Super BigBite experiments
  that will take place in Jefferson Lab's Hall A.</figcaption>
