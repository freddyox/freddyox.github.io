# About
<p>I am a nuclear/particle physics Ph.D. candidate stationed at 
<a href="https://www.jlab.org/">Jefferson Laboratory</a> in Newport News, VA.
The research analysis required computational and programming skills that I
wanted to acquire.  In order to quickly learn, I started working on often
physics-inspired projects during my spare time, and eventually developed new passion.
The purpose of this site is to organize all my side-projects for my own
satisfaction, and for any one else that may find the projects interesting.
The programming language of choice is typically C++ (sometimes Python, Java, or Javascript),
and I make heavy use of the bare-bones multimedia library
<a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a> in addition to
CERN's scientific framework <a href="https://root.cern.ch/">ROOT</a>
for statistical tools, <i>e.g.</i> plotting, fit functions, and probability
distributions. All algorithms including visualization and user-interaction
are my own implementation unless explicitly stated otherwise.
While other higher level tools exist, I chose to do it this
way for my own education and curiosity.
The list of projects may be found <a href="{{ "/blog/" | absolute_url }}">here</a>. </p>

## Ph.D. Research

<p>The overwhelming majority of visible matter is composed of nucleons (protons and neutrons)
making it arguably the most important strongly interacting system to study.
Nature's most prominent particle may naively be thought of as a composite object
built out of three non-interacting sub-objects, known as quarks, in the large
energy limit; however, the structure of the nucleon is much more complicated,
and consequently far richer, than a simple valence-quark picture. 
There are sea quarks in addition to valence quarks that interact strongly
via the exchange of gluons resulting in a complex vacuum structure, 
and all of which must collectively give rise to the observed
properties of the nucleon, <i>e.g.</i> the radius and mass.
The nucleon is the most well-studied hadron and yet there are still unresolved complexities
in the calculation of properties from first principles of QCD;
<i>this represents a central problem in nuclear physics</i>.
The theoretical difficulty with  the nucleon requires intensive
experimentation, which is steadily increasing our knowledge of hadron
structure and the strong interaction. My research revolves around
utilizing fundamental scattering interactions to probe the
nucleon structure in order to contribute towards a complete understanding
of the nucleon.</p>

  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - A Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detector used for particle
  identification (protons, pions, and kaons). The picture depicts many cables which
  are the signal and high voltage connections to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). There
  are 1,934 PMTs in this particular RICH detector, and the signals are used
  in the analysis to reconstruct cherenkov cones. The electronics on the left handle
  low-level signal processing; the detector is made out of copper/aluminum and vacuum sealed.
  Inside the detector exists a large spherical mirror array, aerogel tiles, and a very
  expensive/toxic gas (atleast when it was used during the HERMES experiments). The
  detector is currently being re-purposed for use in the upcoming Super BigBite experiments
  that will take place in Jefferson Lab's Hall A.</figcaption>
