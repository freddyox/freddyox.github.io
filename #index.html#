	    <h2>Overview of Projects</h2>
	    <p>Programming based projects during my years as a physics graduate student.</p>
	  </header>
	  <p>My Ph.D. analysis required computational and programming skills that I
	    wanted to acquire.  In order to quickly learn, I started working on often
	    physics-inspired projects during my spare time, and eventually developed new passion.
	    The purpose of this site is to organize all my <q>side-projects</q> for my own
	    satisfaction, and for any one else that may find the projects interesting.
	    While a deeper analysis may be performed on most problems,
	    I consider a problem to be complete based on boredom and time considerations.
	    The programming language of choice is typically C++ (not that it matters but C++ is common
	    in my field), and I make heavy use of the bare-bones multimedia library
	    <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a> in addition to
	    CERN's scientific framework <a href="https://root.cern.ch/">ROOT</a>
	    for statistical tools, <i>e.g.</i> plotting, fit functions, and probability
	    distributions. All algorithms including visualization and user-interaction
	    are my own work unless explicitly stated otherwise.
	    While other higher level tools exist, I chose to do it this
	    way for my own education and curiosity.
	    The most recent posts are below, and the full list may be
